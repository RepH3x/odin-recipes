  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Popovers are the American take on an English classic: the Yorkshire Pudding. This recipe is super easy and makes deliciously cripsy yet custardy in the middle popovers that are definitely going to go fast once you bake them!</p>

    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted, divided</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place popover tin in oven while it preheats.</li>
    <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl. Add flour and salt. Beat until the batter is very smooth.</li>
    <li>Put 3/4 teaspoon butter in each popover tin and spread butter up sides of the cup. Quickly divide batter between the buttered cups.</li>
    <li>Bake 30-35 minutes or until popovers have risen and are brown. Do not open the oven while they bake.</li>
