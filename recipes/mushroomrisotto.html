  <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
  <p class="description">Risotto has a bad reputation of being hard to make, but in my opinion, the difficulty is overhyped, it just requires some attention and tenacity! Wow your friends and family with this mouth watering dish, they will beg for more! You have to make sure you use special rice for risotto, like Arborio, because you want it to have the correct starch content.</p>
  <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 shallot, minced</li>
    <li>7 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, sliced.</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cup Arborio rice</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup dry wine</li>
    <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pinch celery salt</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 quart hot vegetable stock</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
    <li>1/4 cup parsley, chopped</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
